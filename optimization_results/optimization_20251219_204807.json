    "instructions": "Task: Classify a facility support email. Read the Subject and Body and output exactly one JSON object with: urgency, sentiment, categories.\n\nOutput requirements\n- Produce exactly one result with the three fields: urgency, sentiment, categories. Do not output explanations or multiple results.\n- categories must be a list of one or more strings from the taxonomy below (multi-label). Do not invent new labels.\n- Base decisions on the concrete content of the email. Ignore greetings/closings and boilerplate when judging tone and intent, but include them in the input text.\n\nUrgency (allowed values)\n- high: Immediate safety hazard or critical outage. Triggers include active fire/smoke, smell of gas, electrical sparking, elevator entrapment, security breach in progress, major/active water leak or flooding, building-wide HVAC or power outage impacting operations.\n- medium: Non-emergency but action should be taken soon. Includes time-bound requests, requests to schedule a technician/inspection/assessment, issues affecting safety/compliance/service quality, or messages asking to address something \u201cat your earliest convenience\u201d or \u201cto prevent complications.\u201d Note: If the sender says \u201cnot urgent\u201d but also requests a visit/assessment or implies operational impact, classify as medium.\n- low: Informational inquiries, documentation requests, or compliments with no immediate impact, deadline, or on-site action requested; messages explicitly stating no action needed.\n\nSentiment (allowed values)\n- positive: Clear, sustained praise/appreciation or expressed confidence/gratitude dominates the tone, even if a minor non-urgent issue is raised.\n- neutral: Primarily informational or process-focused; or brief courtesy praise followed by a routine request without emotional language. Measured concerns without negative emotion.\n- negative: Dissatisfaction, complaint, frustration, or description of harmful impact/urgent problem.\nNote: A single polite line like \u201cappreciate your service\u201d does not by itself make the tone positive if the main content is a problem/request.\n\nCategory taxonomy (choose all that apply)\n- general_inquiries: Broad questions not tied to a specific service action.\n- sustainability_and_environmental_practices: Sustainability, eco-friendly/green practices, energy efficiency, environmental impact reduction, ethical sourcing.\n- specialized_cleaning_services: Cleaning services, disinfecting, cleaning products/chemicals, eco-friendly cleaning.\n- facility_management_issues: FM methodologies, procedures, planning/coordination topics (e.g., space utilization, room allocation, scheduling protocols).\n- routine_maintenance_requests: Inspect/repair/adjust/schedule maintenance; cues include leak, repair, fix, technician visit, inspection/assessment request.\n- quality_and_safety_concerns: Safety signage/visibility, hazards, compliance, quality issues impacting occupant safety or environment.\n- customer_feedback_and_complaints: Feedback about recent service, issues experienced, complaints or service concerns.\nGuidance: Avoid over-classifying. Do not use facility_management_issues for a single localized fix (e.g., one plumbing repair). Pair routine_maintenance_requests with quality_and_safety_concerns when the maintenance request is motivated by a safety/compliance risk.\n\nGeneral strategy\n1) Identify explicit action requests, time sensitivity, and safety/operational impact to set urgency. Treat \u201cearliest convenience\u201d or \u201cto prevent complications\u201d with an action request as medium.\n2) Determine sentiment by the predominant tone: sustained praise/trust => positive; brief courtesy or purely factual => neutral; complaints/frustration/harm => negative.\n3) Assign all relevant categories from the taxonomy based on concrete cues/intent. Use multi-label only when clearly justified.\n\nFew-shot examples\n- Input: Praise-filled note asking for assessment of a minor office plumbing leak; states surroundings are safe; requests routine maintenance at earliest convenience.\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"medium\",\"sentiment\":\"positive\",\"categories\":[\"routine_maintenance_requests\"]}\n\n- Input: Brief appreciation then asks to schedule a technician for a small home bathroom plumbing issue; says it\u2019s not urgent but wants it handled at earliest convenience to prevent complications.\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"medium\",\"sentiment\":\"neutral\",\"categories\":[\"routine_maintenance_requests\"]}\n\n- Input: Space utilization/OR allocation conflicts causing minor delays; requests comprehensive review and recommendations; expresses strong appreciation and confidence in the provider.\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"medium\",\"sentiment\":\"positive\",\"categories\":[\"facility_management_issues\"]}\n\n- Input: Report of strong smell of gas near boiler room; asks for immediate assistance.\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"high\",\"sentiment\":\"negative\",\"categories\":[\"quality_and_safety_concerns\",\"routine_maintenance_requests\"]}",
