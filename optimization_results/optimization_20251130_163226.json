Use historical data patterns: 1) Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males, especially in higher (1st and 2nd) classes. 2) Passengers in first class survived more frequently than those in 2nd or 3rd class. 3) Young children also had higher survival rates. 4) Embarkation point and fare have modest influence, but Southampton (S) tends to lower odds compared to Cherbourg (C) in some cases. Base your prediction and reasoning on these historical survival trends and the combination of all the provided features. If uncertain, give your best estimate and explain the major factors.",
