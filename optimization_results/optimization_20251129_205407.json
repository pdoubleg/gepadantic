    "instructions": "Read the following facility support request and analyze it in detail. Your tasks are:\n\n1. Determine the urgency based on these guidelines:\n   - High: Request requires immediate or urgent action (e.g., affects safety, operations, or critical client needs).\n   - Medium: Action is required soon (e.g., within days or a couple of weeks), but not immediately.\n   - Low: Request is informational, non-urgent, or can be addressed flexibly.\n\n2. Determine the overall sentiment. Use:\n   - Positive: Message is appreciative, polite, expresses gratitude or confidence\u2014even if reporting a problem.\n   - Neutral: Message is factual, direct, polite without clear emotional tone.\n   - Negative: Message contains expressions of dissatisfaction, frustration, or complaint.\n\n3. For category prediction, assign ALL that apply from this comprehensive list (multiple categories per message possible):\n   - facility_management_issues: Issues with the facility such as general maintenance, infrastructure, space usage, or related operational issues.\n   - specialized_cleaning_services: Requests for deep cleaning, eco-friendly cleaning, or cleaning beyond routine service.\n   - emergency_repair_services: Repair requests for malfunctions, damage, or breakdowns that pose urgent needs.\n   - sustainability_and_environmental_practices: Inquiries or concerns about eco-friendly initiatives, energy efficiency, or reducing environmental impact.\n   - general_inquiries: General questions about services, quotes, or information not specific to another listed category.\n   - quality_and_safety_concerns: Specific mentions of issues impacting quality or safety, especially where damage or improper maintenance could cause risk.\n   - cleaning_services_scheduling: Requests specifically about timing/scheduling of cleaning services.\n   - training_and_support_requests: Questions or requests about training programs, support for maintenance/cleaning staff, or how staff are equipped.\n\nPay special attention to domain signals:\n- Gratitude, confidence, or praise often signals positive sentiment\u2014even if feedback is present.\n- Requests for cleaning services, training, or maintenance may require multiple categories from the list.\n- If in doubt, include all plausible relevant categories based on explicit or implicit mentions.\n\nOutput result as JSON with keys: urgency, sentiment, categories (list of all that apply).\n\nFew-shot examples:\n\nINPUT: Subject: Need Immediate Repair Due to Water Leak\n... The leak is causing flooding in the server room. Please treat this as an emergency.\nOUTPUT: {\"urgency\":\"high\",\"sentiment\":\"neutral\",\"categories\":[\"emergency_repair_services\",\"facility_management_issues\"]}\n\nINPUT: Subject: Thank You for Improved Cleaning \u2013 One Suggestion\n... Your new eco-friendly carpet cleaning left the office spotless. Could we schedule this monthly?\nOUTPUT: {\"urgency\":\"low\",\"sentiment\":\"positive\",\"categories\":[\"specialized_cleaning_services\",\"cleaning_services_scheduling\",\"sustainability_and_environmental_practices\"]}\n\nINPUT: Subject: Inquiry About Training Programs for In-House Maintenance\n... Could you provide details about the training you offer to our custodial team?\nOUTPUT: {\"urgency\":\"low\",\"sentiment\":\"neutral\",\"categories\":[\"training_and_support_requests\",\"general_inquiries\"]}",
    "tool:final_result:description": "Analyzes a facility support request email and returns a JSON with urgency (high/medium/low), sentiment (positive/neutral/negative), and ALL applicable categories from an expanded facility support taxonomy. Classifications must cover explicit and implied mentions in the email, drawing from domain-specific category definitions and signals such as gratitude, request for training or specialist services, and whether a specific or general support/information response is requested.",
    "tool:final_result:param:urgency": "Classify the urgency of the request as 'high' if immediate or urgent action is necessary (e.g., safety hazard, damage, critical operations), 'medium' if action is needed soon (but not immediate), and 'low' if the message is informational, non-urgent, or flexible in timing. Use domain context (such as specific deadlines or language indicating urgency) to make this determination.",

Sentiment should consider not just mention of problems but the overall tone\u2014appreciative or constructive messages reporting a problem are often positive.",

Categories should reflect the full scope of the request.",
