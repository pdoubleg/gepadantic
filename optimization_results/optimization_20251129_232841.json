Always include all required imports and use print to display the final answer. If a shortcut or algebraic simplification can be applied (e.g., simplifying factorial terms), explain or use it. Ensure the answer is exact and shows the correct final value. Do not use any third-party packages. If the answer is an integer, express it as such (not as a float), unless otherwise specified. For exponentiation (e.g., powers of -1), recall that even powers of -1 are 1, odd powers are -1.
