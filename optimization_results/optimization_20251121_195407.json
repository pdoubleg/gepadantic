    "instructions": "Predict whether a given Titanic passenger survived the disaster, using the provided features. Use the following domain-specific survival patterns, extracted from historical Titanic data and observed in prior task examples:\n- 'Women and children first' was strongly enforced: females and children under 15 had notably higher survival rates, even if in lower classes.\n- First-class passengers survived at higher rates than second class, who survived more than third class; however, being female or a child typically outweighed class.\n- Adult males, even in first class or with high fares, usually had low survival chances unless accompanied by a family group providing extra protection (e.g., a child or female relative).\n- Higher fares often, but not always, reflect higher class and better cabin location (closer lifeboat access), but the effect is minor compared to sex and age.\n- Boarding port (C, Q, S) had a minimal survival effect versus other factors, but boarding from Cherbourg (C) slightly favored first-class survival due to proximity to lifeboats. Otherwise, this feature is rarely decisive.\n- Group/family size had nuanced effects: children or women with family often survived, but large adult male groups had little advantage. Solo adults, particularly men, had lower survival odds.\n\nStrategy: Explicitly prioritize sex and age. If the passenger is female or a child (under 15), their survival probability increases substantially, regardless of other features. If adult male, survival is rare except in specific family-travel situations in first class. Weigh all features, but do not let fare or port override the main historical patterns. Always support predictions with clear reference to these domain rules.\n\nJustify each prediction by referencing:\n1. Sex (with highest weight)\n2. Age (children under 15 highly favored)\n3. Class (first > second > third)\n4. Family group status\n5. Fare (as a secondary modifier)\n6. Embarkation port (only as a minor tiebreaker)\n\nProvide:\n- Survival prediction (yes/no)\n- Confidence (0-1, higher when sex/age makes outcome clear)\n- Detailed stepwise reasoning (reference above rules for each)\n\nExample:\nInput: class=1, sex=female, age=12, sibsp=2, parch=1, fare=52, embarked=C\nOutput: survived: yes, confidence: 0.97, reasoning: Female child in 1st class, with family, all of which are primary predictors of survival in historical records. High fare and Cherbourg embarkation reinforce this. All major factors point to survival.\n\nInput: class=3, sex=male, age=21, sibsp=0, parch=0, fare=7.7, embarked=Q\nOutput: survived: no, confidence: 0.83, reasoning: Young adult male in third class traveling alone and paying a low fare. All key factors align to low survival odds, as seen in Titanic records.",
    "tool:final_result:description": "Provide a survival prediction for the Titanic passenger, specifying:\n- Did the passenger survive ('yes' or 'no'), based on the composite historical patterns (sex, age, class, family, fare, port)?\n- Confidence score (0-1), expressing how strongly the input matches known survivor or non-survivor profiles (sex and age being most determinative).\n- A clear, feature-by-feature explanation referencing the prioritized impact of sex, age, class, family grouping, fare, and port, and connecting these to known survival statistics.

    "tool:final_result:param:reasoning": "Thoroughly justify the outcome by:\n- Explicitly weighing each feature: sex (strongest), age (children next), class (significant), family/group, fare, and port.\n- Reference historical survival rates: e.g., only 20% of adult males survived overall (even fewer in lower classes), vs. over 70% of females and most children.\n- Mention special exceptions\u2014e.g., some first-class adult males survived (if with family, near boats, or other rare cases)\nConclude with a direct summary: \"Given this passenger's profile and the Titanic data, survival is (likely/unlikely) because...\"",
