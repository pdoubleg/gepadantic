      "Do this:\n",
      "1) Read the full content, including the Subject line.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Assign urgency (one of: high, medium, low):\n",
      "- High: Explicit urgent/immediate/escalation language (e.g., “urgent,” “immediate,” “ASAP,” “escalate”) OR a current safety/security hazard OR a critical service disruption now (e.g., power outage, gas smell/leak, active flooding/burst pipe, sparking/electrical fire risk, elevator entrapment, active break-in/security breach). Prior failed attempts + request for immediate action also ⇒ high.\n",
      "- Medium: Time-bound request (days/this week/soon) or an active issue affecting comfort/operations but not an immediate hazard (e.g., minor/contained leak, HVAC performance decline, routine inspection/follow-up needed). Phrases like “as soon as possible,” “sooner rather than later,” or “at your earliest convenience” with an active issue typically ⇒ medium. If the sender explicitly says “not urgent,” treat as medium only if an active issue exists; otherwise consider low.\n",
      "- Low: Routine inquiry or flexible scheduling with no active issue or disruption (e.g., “when convenient,” “within the next couple of weeks”). Note: “Urgent” anywhere ⇒ high. High ≠ emergency services; it signals immediate priority, not necessarily dispatch.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Assign sentiment (one of: positive, neutral, negative) based on tone, not the presence of an issue:\n",
      "- Positive: appreciative, praising, polite warmth, confidence/trust (e.g., “thank you,” “appreciate,” “fantastic job,” “confident”). This can coexist with an issue report.\n",
      "- Neutral: factual/matter‑of‑fact or polite informational tone, including requests for help or guidance without clear dissatisfaction.\n",
      "- Negative: dissatisfaction, frustration, disappointment, complaints about slow/poor service, or threats to escalate. Only mark negative when that tone is clearly present.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Assign categories (multi‑label; choose any that apply from this allowed set only). Apply these disambiguation rules strictly:\n",
      "- specialized_cleaning_services: Deep/specialized cleaning (carpets, windows, floor waxing/buffing, high‑dusting) OR explicit inquiries about cleaning services/practices/products/certifications.\n",

      "- routine_maintenance_requests: Recurring/non‑acute maintenance for building systems (HVAC comfort/performance, minor/contained leaks, plumbing, routine inspections, maintenance follow‑ups). Excludes cleaning scheduling and facility management coordination.\n",
      "- customer_feedback_and_complaints: Only when there is explicit dissatisfaction, oversight/complaint, slow response concerns, or a request to escalate—even if politely worded. Mere requests for guidance or service are not complaints.\n",
      "- quality_and_safety_concerns: QA/standards/compliance, hygiene/sanitation issues, or oversights that could affect quality/safety (e.g., a technician missed a required routine check, protocol lapse). Do not add solely for routine issues kept safe/contained.\n",
      "- facility_management_issues: Coordination/policy/operations topics such as space utilization, access control/badges, guard/security staffing, or vendor governance. Not for equipment repair, technician follow‑ups, or cleaning scheduling.\n",
      "- emergency_repair_services: Immediate dispatch for critical hazard/failure (burst pipe/active flooding, power outage, gas leak/smell, sparking/electrical hazard, elevator entrapment, active security breach).\n",
      "- general_inquiries: Exploratory/info questions about services/capabilities with no specific incident or booking request. Include when the sender asks about products/practices/certifications.\n",

      "\n",
      "Do this:\n",
      "1) Read the full content, including the Subject line. Ignore placeholders like [Sender]/[Receiver], signatures, disclaimers, and personal anecdotes unless they indicate an issue, request, or timing constraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Assign urgency (one of: high, medium, low):\n",
      "- High: Any explicit urgent/immediate/escalation language (e.g., “urgent,” “immediate,” “ASAP,” “right away,” “escalate”), OR a current safety/security hazard, OR a critical service disruption now (e.g., power outage, gas smell/leak, active flooding/burst pipe, sparking/electrical fire risk, elevator entrapment, active break‑in/security breach). Prior failed attempts combined with a request for immediate action also ⇒ high. Note: “Urgent” in subject/body ⇒ high.\n",
      "- Medium: A time‑bound request (this week/within a few days/soon) or an active issue affecting comfort/operations but not an immediate hazard (e.g., contained/minor leak, HVAC performance decline, plumbing that still functions). Phrases like “as soon as possible,” “sooner rather than later,” or “at your earliest convenience” + an active issue ⇒ medium.\n",
      "- Low: Routine inquiry or scheduling with flexible timing and no active issue/disruption (e.g., “not urgent,” “in the coming weeks,” “when convenient”).\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Assign sentiment (one of: positive, neutral, negative) based on tone, not the presence of an issue:\n",
      "- Positive: Appreciative/praising/warm or confident tone toward the provider (e.g., “thank you,” “appreciate,” “excellent service,” “confident you’ll resolve this”), even if the situation is urgent.\n",
      "- Neutral: Factual/matter‑of‑fact reporting or polite requests with no clear dissatisfaction.\n",
      "- Negative: Expressed dissatisfaction/frustration/complaints about slow/poor service, explicit blame, or threats to escalate.\n",
      "Tie‑breakers: If both praise and frustration are present, choose negative. Urgency alone does NOT imply negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Assign categories (multi‑label; choose any that apply from this allowed set only):\n",
      "- quality_and_safety_concerns: Safety, hygiene/sanitation, cleanliness standards, compliance risk, or QA concerns (e.g., missed checks/protocol lapses/oversight impacting quality or safety).\n",
      "- routine_maintenance_requests: Recurring or non‑acute maintenance for building systems/services (e.g., HVAC comfort/performance, minor/contained leaks, plumbing, routine inspections, maintenance follow‑ups). Do NOT use for cleaning service requests.\n",
      "- customer_feedback_and_complaints: Dissatisfaction, oversight/service complaints, slow response, or requests to escalate—even if politely phrased.\n",
      "- specialized_cleaning_services: Deep/specialty cleaning work (carpets, windows, floor waxing/buffing, high‑dusting) or explicit inquiries about cleaning methods/services.\n",
      "- cleaning_services_scheduling: Scheduling or rescheduling a cleaning service visit.\n",
      "- facility_management_issues: Coordination/policy/operations topics such as space utilization, access control/badges, security measures/staffing, vendor oversight/governance. Do NOT use for a single‑system repair/technician maintenance.\n",
      "- emergency_repair_services: Immediate dispatch for a critical failure/hazard (burst pipe/active flooding, power outage, gas leak/smell, sparking/electrical hazard, elevator entrapment, active security breach).\n",
      "- general_inquiries: Exploratory/info questions about services/capabilities with no specific incident or work order.\n",
      "- training_and_support_requests: Requests for training, manuals, SOPs, or support programs for in‑house teams.\n",
      "- sustainability_and_environmental_practices: Questions about eco‑friendly/green cleaning or energy efficiency practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important disambiguation rules:\n",
      "- Cleaning vs. maintenance: Requests to perform cleaning (especially deep/specialized) ⇒ specialized_cleaning_services; if they ask to schedule it ⇒ add cleaning_services_scheduling. Do NOT tag routine_maintenance_requests for cleaning service requests.\n",
      "- HVAC comfort/performance issues ⇒ routine_maintenance_requests; add quality_and_safety_concerns only if standards/compliance/QA are implicated.\n",
      "- Technician oversight/missed routine check + follow‑up ⇒ routine_maintenance_requests + customer_feedback_and_complaints; add quality_and_safety_concerns if standards/compliance/QA are mentioned or implied.\n",
      "- Eco‑friendly/green cleaning info without a service incident ⇒ general_inquiries + sustainability_and_environmental_practices; add training_and_support_requests if they ask for programs/SOPs; add specialized_cleaning_services only if asking about cleaning services/practices.\n",
      "- Do not tag facility_management_issues for single‑system equipment repair or a technician’s missed task.\n",
      "- Mentioning eco‑friendly products as a value alignment without asking about them does NOT by itself add sustainability_and_environmental_practices.\n",
      "- If an email both schedules a cleaning and asks about available slots, prefer cleaning_services_scheduling (+ specialized_cleaning_services if deep/specialty is specified) over general_inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Output exactly one JSON object with keys: urgency, sentiment, categories (array of strings). No extra keys or commentary.\n",
      "\n",
      "General strategy:\n",
      "- First, scan subject/body for urgency keywords and any active hazards/disruptions.\n",
      "- Second, infer tone to set sentiment (praise/confidence can be positive even under urgency; reserve negative for clear dissatisfaction/complaints/escalation).\n",
      "- Third, map issues/requests to all relevant categories; include both the issue type (e.g., maintenance or cleaning) and any meta‑feedback (complaint/quality/safety) when present.\n",
      "\n",

       "{'instructions': 'Classify a facility support email by urgency, sentiment, and categories.\\n\\nDo this:\\n1) Read the full content, including the Subject line.\\n2) Assign urgency (one of: high, medium, low):\\n- High: Explicit urgent/immediate/escalation language (e.g., “urgent,” “immediate,” “ASAP,” “escalate”) OR a current safety/security hazard OR a critical service disruption now (e.g., power outage, gas smell/leak, active flooding/burst pipe, sparking/electrical fire risk, elevator entrapment, active break-in/security breach). Prior failed attempts + request for immediate action also indicate high.\\n- Medium: Time-bound request (days/this week/soon) or an active issue that affects comfort/operations but is not an immediate hazard (e.g., ongoing leak contained but present, HVAC performance decline, minor plumbing issues). Phrases like “as soon as possible,” “sooner rather than later,” or “at your earliest convenience” with an active issue typically ⇒ medium.\\n- Low: Routine inquiry or scheduling with flexible timing and no active issue or disruption (e.g., “when convenient,” “within the next couple of weeks”).\\nNote: “Urgent” in subject/body ⇒ high. High ≠ emergency services; it signals immediate priority.\\n\\n3) Assign sentiment (one of: positive, neutral, negative) based on tone, not the presence of an issue:\\n- Positive: appreciative, praising, polite warmth, confident trust (e.g., “thank you,” “appreciate,” “fantastic job,” “confident”).\\n- Neutral: factual/informational or politely matter‑of‑fact, including polite reports of issues without clear dissatisfaction.\\n- Negative: dissatisfaction, frustration, disappointment, complaints about slow/poor service, or threats to escalate.\\n\\n4) Assign categories (multi‑label; choose any that apply from this allowed set only):\\n- quality_and_safety_concerns: Safety, hygiene/sanitation, cleanliness standards, compliance risk, or service quality/QA concerns (e.g., missed checks, protocol lapses, oversight that risks quality or safety).\\n- routine_maintenance_requests: Recurring or non‑acute maintenance for building systems/services (e.g., HVAC comfort/performance, minor leaks, plumbing, routine inspections, maintenance follow‑ups). If linked to quality/safety standards or missed checks, also include quality_and_safety_concerns.\\n- customer_feedback_and_complaints: Explicit dissatisfaction, service issues/oversight complaints, slow response, or requests to escalate. Include even if polite.\\n- specialized_cleaning_services: Deep/specialized cleaning (e.g., carpets, windows, floor waxing/buffing, high‑dusting) or inquiries specifically about cleaning services/practices.\\n- cleaning_services_scheduling: Scheduling or rescheduling a cleaning service.\\n- facility_management_issues: Coordination/policy/operations topics such as space utilization, access control/badges, guard/security staffing, vendor oversight/governance. Do not use for specific system repair or technician maintenance oversight.\\n- emergency_repair_services: Immediate dispatch for critical failure or hazard (e.g., burst pipe, active flooding, power outage, gas leak/smell, sparking/electrical hazard, elevator entrapment).\\n- general_inquiries: Exploratory or informational questions about services/capabilities with no specific service incident or work order.\\n- training_and_support_requests: Requests for training, manuals, SOPs, or support programs for in‑house maintenance/cleaning teams.\\n- sustainability_and_environmental_practices: Sustainability/eco‑friendly practices, green cleaning, energy efficiency inquiries.\\n\\nImportant disambiguation:\\n- HVAC comfort/performance issues ⇒ routine_maintenance_requests; add quality_and_safety_concerns if a check was missed or standards/compliance/QA are implicated.\\n- Technician oversight/missed routine check plus a follow‑up request ⇒ routine_maintenance_requests + customer_feedback_and_complaints; add quality_and_safety_concerns if quality/standards mentioned or implied.\\n- General info requests about eco‑friendly cleaning + training programs (no incident) ⇒ general_inquiries + sustainability_and_environmental_practices; add training_and_support_requests; add specialized_cleaning_services if cleaning services/practices are asked about.\\n- Do not tag facility_management_issues for single‑system maintenance or a technician’s missed task.\\n\\n5) Output exactly one JSON object with keys: urgency, sentiment, categories (array of strings). No extra keys or commentary.\\n\\nGeneral strategy:\\n- First, scan subject/body for urgency keywords and any active hazards/disruptions.\\n- Second, infer tone to set sentiment (polite but critical can still be neutral; reserve negative for clear dissatisfaction/complaints/escalation).\\n- Third, map issues/requests to all relevant categories; include both the issue type (e.g., maintenance) and any meta‑feedback (complaint/quality/safety) when present.\\n\\nFew-shot examples:\\n- Example A: Subject: Urgent—Multiple Issues Affecting Safety and Comfort; recurring HVAC discomfort; cleaning neglected; prior slow responses; asks to escalate.\\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"high\",\"sentiment\":\"negative\",\"categories\":[\"quality_and_safety_concerns\",\"routine_maintenance_requests\",\"customer_feedback_and_complaints\"]}\\n- Example B: Subject: Request for Specialized Cleaning Services; praises service; asks to schedule carpet/window deep cleaning; flexible timing in next couple of weeks.\\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"low\",\"sentiment\":\"positive\",\"categories\":[\"specialized_cleaning_services\",\"cleaning_services_scheduling\"]}\\n- Example C: Subject: Immediate Assistance Required for Facility Management Issue; space utilization and security coordination gone awry; needs immediate intervention; appreciative tone.\\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"high\",\"sentiment\":\"positive\",\"categories\":[\"facility_management_issues\"]}\\n- Example D: Subject: Inquiry About Services; asks about eco‑friendly cleaning practices and training programs; no urgency; complimentary tone.\\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"low\",\"sentiment\":\"positive\",\"categories\":[\"general_inquiries\",\"training_and_support_requests\",\"sustainability_and_environmental_practices\",\"specialized_cleaning_services\"]}\\n- Example E: Subject: Feedback on Recent Maintenance Service; technician missed routine HVAC check; slight performance decline; requests follow‑up; polite tone.\\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"medium\",\"sentiment\":\"neutral\",\"categories\":[\"routine_maintenance_requests\",\"customer_feedback_and_complaints\",\"quality_and_safety_concerns\"]}\\n- Example F: Subject: Guidance Needed for Routine Plumbing Maintenance; small leak present, contained; requests assessment at earliest convenience; appreciative tone.\\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"medium\",\"sentiment\":\"positive\",\"categories\":[\"routine_maintenance_requests\"]}\\n- Example G: Subject: Urgent—Power Out on 3rd Floor; immediate outage.\\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"high\",\"sentiment\":\"neutral\",\"categories\":[\"emergency_repair_services\"]}',\n",
