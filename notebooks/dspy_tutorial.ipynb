      "- medium: Non-emergency but action should be taken soon. Includes time-bound requests, requests to schedule a technician/inspection/assessment, issues affecting safety/compliance/service quality, or messages asking to address something “at your earliest convenience” or “to prevent complications.” Note: If the sender says “not urgent” but also requests a visit/assessment or implies operational impact, classify as medium.\n",

      "- negative: Dissatisfaction, complaint, frustration, or description of harmful impact/urgent problem.\n",

Read the Subject and Body and output exactly one JSON object with: urgency, sentiment, categories.\\n\\nOutput requirements\\n- Produce exactly one result with the three fields: urgency, sentiment, categories. Do not output explanations or multiple results.\\n- categories must be a list of one or more strings from the taxonomy below (multi-label). Do not invent new labels.\\n- Base decisions on the concrete content of the email. Ignore greetings/closings and boilerplate when judging tone and intent, but include them in the input text.\\n\\nUrgency (allowed values)\\n- high: Immediate safety hazard or critical outage. Triggers include active fire/smoke, smell of gas, electrical sparking, elevator entrapment, security breach in progress, major/active water leak or flooding, building-wide HVAC or power outage impacting operations.\\n- medium: Non-emergency but action should be taken soon. Includes time-bound requests, requests to schedule a technician/inspection/assessment, issues affecting safety/compliance/service quality, or messages asking to address something “at your earliest convenience” or “to prevent complications.” Note: If the sender says “not urgent” but also requests a visit/assessment or implies operational impact, classify as medium.\\n- low: Informational inquiries, documentation requests, or compliments with no immediate impact, deadline, or on-site action requested; messages explicitly stating no action needed.\\n\\nSentiment (allowed values)\\n- positive: Clear, sustained praise/appreciation or expressed confidence/gratitude dominates the tone, even if a minor non-urgent issue is raised.\\n- neutral: Primarily informational or process-focused; or brief courtesy praise followed by a routine request without emotional language. Measured concerns without negative emotion.\\n- negative: Dissatisfaction, complaint, frustration, or description of harmful impact/urgent problem.\\nNote: A single polite line like “appreciate your service” does not by itself make the tone positive if the main content is a problem/request.\\n\\nCategory taxonomy (choose all that apply)\\n- general_inquiries: Broad questions not tied to a specific service action.\\n- sustainability_and_environmental_practices: Sustainability, eco-friendly/green practices, energy efficiency, environmental impact reduction, ethical sourcing.\\n- specialized_cleaning_services: Cleaning services, disinfecting, cleaning products/chemicals, eco-friendly cleaning.\\n- facility_management_issues: FM methodologies, procedures, planning/coordination topics (e.g., space utilization, room allocation, scheduling protocols).\\n- routine_maintenance_requests: Inspect/repair/adjust/schedule maintenance; cues include leak, repair, fix, technician visit, inspection/assessment request.\\n- quality_and_safety_concerns: Safety signage/visibility, hazards, compliance, quality issues impacting occupant safety or environment.\\n- customer_feedback_and_complaints: Feedback about recent service, issues experienced, complaints or service concerns.\\nGuidance: Avoid over-classifying. Do not use facility_management_issues for a single localized fix (e.g., one plumbing repair). Pair routine_maintenance_requests with quality_and_safety_concerns when the maintenance request is motivated by a safety/compliance risk.\\n\\nGeneral strategy\\n1) Identify explicit action requests, time sensitivity, and safety/operational impact to set urgency. Treat “earliest convenience” or “to prevent complications” with an action request as medium.\\n2) Determine sentiment by the predominant tone: sustained praise/trust => positive; brief courtesy or purely factual => neutral; complaints/frustration/harm => negative.\\n3) Assign all relevant categories from the taxonomy based on concrete cues/intent. Use multi-label only when clearly justified.\\n\\nFew-shot examples\\n- Input: Praise-filled note asking for assessment of a minor office plumbing leak; states surroundings are safe; requests routine maintenance at earliest convenience.\\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"medium\",\"sentiment\":\"positive\",\"categories\":[\"routine_maintenance_requests\"]}\\n\\n- Input: Brief appreciation then asks to schedule a technician for a small home bathroom plumbing issue; says it’s not urgent but wants it handled at earliest convenience to prevent complications.\\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"medium\",\"sentiment\":\"neutral\",\"categories\":[\"routine_maintenance_requests\"]}\\n\\n- Input: Space utilization/OR allocation conflicts causing minor delays; requests comprehensive review and recommendations; expresses strong appreciation and confidence in the provider.\\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"medium\",\"sentiment\":\"positive\",\"categories\":[\"facility_management_issues\"]}\\n\\n- Input: Report of strong smell of gas near boiler room; asks for immediate assistance.\\n  Output: {\"urgency\":\"high\",\"sentiment\":\"negative\",\"categories\":[\"quality_and_safety_concerns\",\"routine_maintenance_requests\"]}',\n",
