C5–C6 disc protrusion with right C6 radiculopathy, following MVC on 04/02/2025.\n2. Chronic cervical pain, partially responsive to conservative care.\n\nPLAN:\n- Recommend fluoroscopy-guided cervical epidural steroid injection (CESI) at C5–C6 level.\n- Discussed risks (bleeding, infection, nerve injury, transient increased pain, steroid side effects) and benefits.
